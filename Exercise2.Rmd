## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library}
library(readr)        # to import tabular data (e.g. csv)
library(dplyr)        # to manipulate (tabular) data
library(ggplot2)      # to visualize data
library(sf)           # to handle spatial vector data
library(terra)        # To handle raster data
library(lubridate)    # To handle dates and times
```

```{r datainput}
## Import the downloaded csv 
wildschwein_BE <- read_delim("wildschwein_BE_2056.csv",",") # adjust path

wildschwein_BE <- st_as_sf(wildschwein_BE, coords = c("E", "N"), crs = 2056, remove = FALSE)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
